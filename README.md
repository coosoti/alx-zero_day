These tools include version control git, github as a tool for collaboration and how these tools are used together in the dev industry.

The core of day 0 projects is to focus on text editors used in the unix terminal. Farmiliarity with the editors is paramount for a smooth sailing as a software engineers. Thus, the project focuses on vi(m) found almost in all installations of linux based distros. It is therefore important for one to understand its basic operations. There is also emacs which is customizable text editor that is powerful and can be configured to act as a rich text editor for an awesome experience.
